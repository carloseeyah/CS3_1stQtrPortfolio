# **Take on SONA July 2025 of Pres. Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.** 
#### By Carlo Sia 9-Beryllium

## **Interesting Key Points:**

### 1. "*Bente Pesong Bigas*"
#### I found this quite interesting as while the price is beneficial for many Filipinos, the actual price of rice still remains way higher. This price is almost only due to subsidization from the government.

### 2. "*Adding More School Counselors and Child Development Centers*"
#### While this is a good promise which should be kept, I found it interesting knowing how culturally, most Filipinos have been known to disregard mental health, especially because of generation traumas and more.

### 3. "*Compensation For Teaching Overload and Overtime*"
#### While BBM acknowledges the struggles and hardwork of the teachers, I found the digitilization of applications the most interesting part of this key point. It highlights how the government and BBM as at least taking steps and full incorporating technology within our systems.

### 4. "*Flood Control Projects*"
#### Reflects more consideration from the government as well as accountability for the half-decent and corrupted flood-control projects within LGUs. BBM acknowledged and claims that he will hold the corrupt individuals accountable.

## **Weird Key Points:**

### 1. "*New "Champion" - PNP Chief*"
#### I found this "point" very weird as it was included within a speeceh congratulating and acknowledging actual national athletes of the Philippines. I found that while humor and laughs should be welcome, this comment was unnecessary and unfit for an important address such as the SONA.

### 2. "*Totoong Balita and Dangers of Misinformation*"
#### This was definitely weird as BBM and his supporters were well known for spreading misinformation and certain propaganda during the presidential election. I found it not only weird, but also hypocritical.

# **Reflections**

### "*Lackluster and Inaction*"
#### Seen in my previous explanations, I find myself reflecting on the integrity and content of the SONA. While many of the status updates seemed genuine and realistic, the lack of data and evidence within the speech itself begs to differ. I especially realized this when BBM was discussing the updates for PhilHealth, DoH and public hospitals. While he claimed many new free benefits such as free check ups, dialysis, and more, upon actually going to a public hospital would one realize the lack and outdatedness of the facilities. The update on the benefits and the lack of acknowledgment about the cleanliness and accessibility of these hospitals reflect to me that there is still a massive margin for improvement.

### "*Technology and Digitilization*"
#### From my perspective, one of the biggest highlights of the SONA were the status updates regarding the active implementations of technology into work and government systems. Notably, the digitilization of documents required for application for teachers, free wifi sites, and the eGov application. With this new and updated approach, I hope that the Philippines would be able to solve its crisis in the education sector and that we may be able to fully utilize the technology we have at hand. In the end, however, the government should be working more towards making the technology more accessible, particularly the physical devices. Many schools, work sites, and other public systems still lack the necessary laptops and/or cellphones to be able to fully utilize these new changes.

## **A Phrase for SONA 2025**
### "*A Sona With Many News and Knews"
##### This SONA is one with many new addresses and updates, however the known issues of corruption, inaction, and lack of accessibility still stand as it has for decades.
